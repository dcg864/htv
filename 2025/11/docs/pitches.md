#1 - Autodefacer that lets you know what exploit it leveraged in the defacement

#3 - Python / AI Agent that takes source code input and creates exploits based on the source and executes the exploit based on that.
4 - Target specific type of vulnerability and the tool walks you progressively through the exploit as a means of teaching you what its doing, why its doing it, and how its doing it.
5 - Exploits vulnerability, establishes C2, closes/remediates initial exploit.  Potential hack-back bonus points for attacking someone who attempts to exploit the initial vulnerability.
